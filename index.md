# About Me
{: .fs-9 }

I've been working in IT for a number of years and tend to lose large portions of documentation or notes between roles. I'll be using this to store and track the things I'm doing. And the things I'm studying. If you find anything of use or if you need any clarification feel free to let me know.

## Getting started
I`m currently working on Infrastructure and Configuration Managememt using Terraform, Ansible, Chef and Ansible Tower. I'm primarily working in AWS Cloud Services, so most of my examples and test code will be focussed on this.

I've got a few personal projects that focus on Raspberry Pi and electronics integration. These items may get published in my Github repo as I feel comfortable releasing them.
