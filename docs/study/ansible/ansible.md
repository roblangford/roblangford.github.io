# Ansible
Currently I am looking into Ansible and Ansible Tower (AWX) for deployment and configuration management in both Linux and Windows.
I use a mixture of technologies including Ansible Tower in my day to day, I'm hoping that the further development and study I do in this space will benefit me professionally.


## Ansible Tower (AWX)

Redhat Ansible Tower is a centralised control system for managing complex deployments, configuration and inventory of software. It can simplfy the processes and management via jobs and runbooks.

There is an opensource edition of Tower called AWX, I am currently testing this out but more details can be found: [Ansible AWX (GitHub)](https://github.com/ansible/awx)



## Study and training

There aren't a lot of training options available for Ansible Tower and the Cost of Redhat training can be too steep as an entry for some. I have partaken in some of their free training sessions however the company I work for has a subscription which allows me to access and use Redhat resources.

Youtube has some example and short video tutorials on using or configuring some of the aspects of Ansible Tower however there isn't a comprehensive set of couses I've found. If you have any recommendations please feel free to shoot me a link.
As I delve deeper into the options and solutions that can be developed with Ansible and Tower I'll work on building up the pages here.
I plan on exploring deployment, configuration, Patching and other maintenance tasks.
