# Terraform

I'm currently working through Pluralsight, Terraform Docs and Linux Academy. So far there is a lot of great information and the Hashicorp Learn page (link below).
I can certainly recommend checking out [Ned Bellavance](https://nedinthecloud.com/) on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NedintheCloud/), Terraform Tuesdays are going to give you some real life working examples to test and play around with before getting busy at work.
